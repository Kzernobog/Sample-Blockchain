# Sample-Blockchain
A basic implementation of a blockchain. This is mainly to understand the various concepts of a blockchain. It has been inspired from a Medium article written recently by Daniel Van Flymen

The 3 shell scripts are to interact with the blockchain's API
1) add a transaction - ./add_transaction.sh sender recipient amount
2) to get a copy of the complete blockchain - ./get_chain.sh
3) to mine and create a new block - ./mine.sh

As a primer - PoW.py is to understand what the proof of work algorithm is used for.
